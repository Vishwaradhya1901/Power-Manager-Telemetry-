In our study on power consumption in devices, we utilized Ubuntu Powertop to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Understand Power Consumption**: By leveraging Powertop, we accurately measured the power usage of different components under various conditions, gaining insights into their consumption patterns.
2. **Optimize and Improve Power Usage**: Using the data obtained, we developed strategies to enhance power efficiency, leading to improved overall device performance.
3. **Reduce Power Wastage**: We identified areas of power wastage and implemented measures to eliminate them, thereby saving energy and reducing costs.
4. **Achieve Efficient Power Utilization**: Ensuring power is used efficiently across different system levels, we maximized energy utilization and minimized unnecessary consumption.

By employing Ubuntu Powertop, we were able to conduct a comprehensive analysis and optimization of power usage in devices.
